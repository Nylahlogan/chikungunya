 <img src="images/nylahpic.jpg" style="width:400px; height:500px; "><p> Hi my names is Nylah, you can reach me at Nylah.whittler@scholar.smash.org  email or add me on linked in. Nylah loves all colors, and her birthday is January 30th. She has 5 siblings, who annoy her alot, but she loves them dearly. She enjoys watching Netflix, and Youtube in her freetime. She attends University Prep Science and Math High School, where she's going into her 10th grade year. She's a cheerleader for the Cobras, and she wishes to be moved up to Varsity for the new season. If you know Nylah, you know about how even though she's young, she has mother instincts, and loves to help in anyway she can. That leads up to the reasoning why she would like to go into the pediatrics field in nursing. Also, learning and educating many about urban ecology.
