	 <p>  Our disease is spread to humans through a mosquito who is infected injecting the virus into the humans blood stream when going to suck the personâ€™s blood. After the host is injected, it takes them about a week or so to start feeling symptoms of having the virus. The symptoms range from ( headache, joint pain, fever, rashes, swelling of the joints, and muscles. The most susceptible people to get the virus would be tourists, and the people who actually live in the areas where the virus is more active.
 	Our solution would be to create a mosquito repellent box that would containn items like: lotion, a mist, soap, braclets, and a chapstick.</p>
